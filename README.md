**Problem statement**

Social media are characterizing the first part of the third millennium and today represent strategic communication channels. In fact, they allow companies to leverage the power of exchanges between people to positively direct their attitudes and behaviors towards their own corporate image, brand or products / services provided. In other words, social media provide detailed real-time feedback from consumers which constitutes real "market intelligence". The contents published on social networks can be of different types: bodies of text, images, videos, etc. This project, carried out using VGG16, PCA and K-Means, aims to provide a way to cluster pictures of an instagram page by visual similarity.

**Practical implications**

Different applications of a similar image-clustering algorithm can help answer several questions and support social media managers in their decision-making process by allowing to analyze both your own page and that of your competitors: 

- What kind of images a social page mainly publishes? Which are the trending images over time? What are the images that most involve followers in terms of likes and comments?

**Possible improvements**

- This project has been developed using publicly available data. The owners of a social page have access to more advanced statistics (e.g. the number of new followers a certain post has generated or the number of times a certain post has been reshared). Integrating this type of statistics into the analysis can provide even more useful insights.
